Source codes

The zipped folder Source_code.zip . You will find source code for each approach.   In particular , you can find the source code with the corresponding instrumented 
benchmark function.

Experimental_data_results

The zipped folder Experimental_data_results.zip includes the experimental results obtained by each approach. After extracting the zipped folder, you will find more folders
with each approach's name. Inside each of these folders is the experimental data collected per benchmark function. Inide each folder, is an excel file with the data

Colum 1 : Row 1 to Row 30  is the loop path coverage (%) per run.
Colum 1 : Row 36 : You will find the mean of the average loop path overage over the 35 programs

Colum 2 : Row 1 to Row 30  is the number of loop paths covered per run.
Colum 2 : Row 36 : You will find the average number of loop paths covered over the 30 runs


Colum 30 : Row 1 to Row 16 Is the sum  of loop paths covered at each coverage point every afer 20 seconds in each run.
There are 16 coverage points for each run. For example, Colum 30 : Row 1. Is the sum of the accumulated number of covered paths covered in the first 20 seconds over the 30 runs
