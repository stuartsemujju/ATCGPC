To help othe researchers intergate our approach into their frameworks, we provide explanation of the code sections . Noe that the source code is not necessarily up to production quality as it would take alot of time and resources to build a production ready tool. However, for future work we plan to implement our approch in tool with a usable interface.

The source code example provided is based on the instrumenataion program diamond 1-1. We explain the key functions of our proposed approach.
